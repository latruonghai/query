# Information Retrieval
- You can retrieve your data base on the model we trained.
## In this project we have 3 options:
- Crawl the data from webpages: if you want to get the information from the webpages ['vnexpress', 'traveloka', 'wikipedia'] you can use Crawl module
- Query the data from db: if you want to retrieve the data, use Query module in *'model'* package.
- Render on webpage: make the tools more interesting.
